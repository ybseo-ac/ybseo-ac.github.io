*(Looking for Ph.D. opportunities in the U.S.!!)*

Hi! I am a second-year M.S. student at Yonsei University.  I am currently at the ML3 lab of professor [Jaehyung Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/jaehyungkim)  for a research exchange.  I was previously advised by professor [Jinyoung Yeo](https://jinyeo.weebly.com/). I received B.S. in Educational Science from Yonsei University. I also served as a journalist specializing in data analysis in [Donga Ilbo](https://www.donga.com/), which is one of the top major newspapers in South Korea.


#### Research Interest  (ML, NLP)
  My research is focused on building human-like self-evolving AI, and I believe this requires improving the architecture of LMs. For example, to accelerate RL in LMs, the LMs need goal-orientation (bidirectional attention) and faster generation speed, which motivated my research on **diffusion LMs**.  Moreover, for RL of LMs, the token-level granularity of LMs should be compressed into concept-level units in order to avoid the long-horizon (i.e., sparse reward) problem, so I'm currently working on **hierarchical LMs** (i.e., **latent reasoning**). 

  Also, I conducted research on **continual knowledge learning**, which is essential in self-evolving AI. I also explored **efficient learning via data pruning**, which will be required for continual learning of a vast stream of text data. I am potentially open to research on **embodied agent**, to build the **emotion and personality of LM**.
